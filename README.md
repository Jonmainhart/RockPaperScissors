# RockPaperScissors
A simple Java-based text rock, paper, scissors game

created by @jonmainhart

I created this as a fun way to pass the time while sitting in an airport for a few hours. It is a very basic interpretation of Rock, Paper, Scissors (or Ro-Sham-Bo depending on your locale) that one can play against a computer opponent.

- Choose from an array of weapons like rocks, paper, and scissors!
- Play against your favorite (and only) computer opponent!
- Gloat to your friends in 1970 about how you have the latest RPS game on the market!
- Keeps score so you can shwo the world how superior you are to a simple machine!

Enjoy!
