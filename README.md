# RockPaperScissors
A simple Java-based text rock, paper, scissors game

created by @jonmainhart

I created this as a fun way to pass the time while sitting in an airport for a few hours. It is a very basic interpretation of Rock, Paper, Scissors (or Ro-Sham-Bo depending on your locale) that one can play against a computer opponent.

I am sorry if you choose to download and compile on your machine because it is not very useful or fun.

Enjoy!
